# BREAD

BREAD is an acronym, just like CRUD:

- B - Browse
- R - Read
- E - Edit
- A - Add
- D - Delete

You can read a little more about BREAD [here](http://paul-m-jones.com/post/2008/08/20/bread-not-crud/)

## Why?

We as developers waste a lot of time creating the code to create views/forms and controllers to handle the logic to have a list of records or just to create and/or edit a record. We aim to reduce this time using this [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) Package
